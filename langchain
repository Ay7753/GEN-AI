LangChain is an open-source Python (and JS) framework designed to help developers build applications powered by Large Language Models (LLMs).
Instead of just sending a single prompt â†’ getting a single response, LangChain lets you chain together multiple components like prompts, models, tools, and data sources to create complex, context-aware GenAI systems.
